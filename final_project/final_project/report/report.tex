\section{Introduction}

This project aimed to explore connectivity between directors of the 5000 movies,  ranked by IMDB.  The dataset consists of multiple genres across a very large timespan: 1920s to Present (2022).  The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.com and is titled: "IMDb 5000+ Movies \& Multiple Genres Dataset".  

The project's language is Rust and the entirety of the project was completed solely by Ben Kahan.  The chosen VCS is git and the project's repository is hosted on GitHub.  I edited and debugged using IntelliJ Pro with the Rust plugin.
